👋 Hey there, code wanderer!

👨‍💻 I'm always tinkering and experimenting in the realms of C++, C, Ruby, Crystal, Elixir, Python, etc... I adore unraveling the mysteries of these languages, constantly sharpening my skills to conjure wonders.

🧠 Delve into my realm to uncover the secrets of my Emacs configuration and dotfiles. It's a playground of efficiency and power, evolving as I weave new enchantments.

📧 Questions, curious musings, or geeky discussions? Ping me at <a href="mailto:corentin.roy02@laposte.net?subject=Coding+Wonders&&body=Let's+talk+code+magic!" target="_blank">corentin.roy02@laposte.net</a>. Let's weave some code magic together!

P.S. I'm currently brewing magic as a freelance developer. Want to craft something extraordinary? Reach out, and let's make it happen! 😉✨
