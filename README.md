👋 Hello there!

👨‍💻 I'm a junior developer and Epitech student with a passion for coding in a variety of languages. I have extensive knowledge of languages such as C, C++, and Python that I've learned during my time at Epitech. In addition to those, I've also worked on internship and personal projects that allowed me to explore languages such as Ruby, Crystal, and JavaScript/TypeScript for React.

📚 Here are a few things you'll find on my GitHub profile:

🔍 Projects that showcase my love for algorithms and optimization in C++. You'll find lots of code examples that demonstrate my ability to make things run fast and efficiently in this language.

💎 Ruby and Crystal projects that highlight my expertise in these programming languages. I love working with Ruby and Crystal and enjoy exploring all the amazing things you can do with them!

🧠 An Emacs configuration that showcases my love for this powerful text editor. As a fan of Emacs, I've spent a lot of time customizing it to suit my needs, and I'm always looking for new ways to make it even more efficient and useful.

🌎 A portfolio to present some of the projects I worked on.

📧 If you have any questions or just want to chat about programming, you can always reach me at corentin.roy02@laposte.net. Don't hesitate to drop me a line!

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding!

**I am currently working as freelance web developer, feel free to contact me** 😉
